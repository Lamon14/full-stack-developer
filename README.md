#Your Spring Boot Project

## Description
This project is a full-stack Employee Management System developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend. 
The backend is designed to model and manage employee-related data through a robust relational database schema, 
with a focus on key JPA (Java Persistence API) components such as entities, relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, etc.), 
repositories (Spring Data JPA), and service layers to encapsulate business logic.

The backend exposes RESTful APIs via Spring Web, enabling CRUD operations on employee data. 
These endpoints are consumed by the frontend, which is built using React and bundled using Vite for faster development and performance optimization. 
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee records, enabling features such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee details.

To test the application, clone the project from GitHub. Run the backend by executing the BraintrustApplication class,
and start the frontend by navigating to the frontend folder and run npm run dev.

If you do not have npm installed then install npm (dependencies) with this command: npm install and then after run "npm run dev" (to start the development server)
