#Your Spring Boot Project

## Description
This is a Spring Boot application for an Employee Management System, I focus on several key concepts such
as entities, relationships, repositories, and services. The primary objective is to design a relational database
schema that effectively stores and manages employee data. This data is then exposed through the Spring Boot
application via endpoints, allowing interaction with the system. Additionally, the data can be populated and managed
through a front-end application built with React and Vite, providing a seamless user interface for interacting with
the employee management system.

To test the application, clone the project from GitHub. Run the backend by executing the BraintrustApplication class,
and start the frontend by navigating to the frontend folder and running npm run dev.

If you do not have npm installed then install npm with this command: npm install and then after "npm run dev"
